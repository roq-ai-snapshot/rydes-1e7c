3. As a BusinessOwner, I want to set a default travelling allowance for all employees so that I can ensure a consistent allowance across the company.

4. As a BusinessOwner, I want to assign specific travelling allowances to individual employees so that I can accommodate unique circumstances or job roles.

5. As a TeamMember, I want to view the travelling allowances of the employees in my team so that I can manage and approve their expenses.

6. As an Accountant, I want to view all employee travelling allowances so that I can track and manage the company's travel expenses.

7. As an Employee, I want to view my travelling allowance so that I can plan and budget my work-related travel expenses.

8. As a BusinessOwner, I want to update the travelling allowance for an employee so that I can adjust the allowance based on changes in job roles or company policies.

9. As a BusinessOwner, I want to remove an employee's travelling allowance so that I can discontinue the allowance for employees who no longer require it.

10. As a BusinessOwner, I want to delete a Company profile so that I can remove my company's information from the app if I no longer wish to use the service.`;
